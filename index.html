        <p>Protected areas or conservation areas are locations which receive protection <br>
            because of their recognized natural, ecological or cultural values. There are  <br>
            several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending <br>
            on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international <br>
            organizations involved. Generally speaking though, protected areas are understood<br> 
            to be those in which human presence or at least the exploitation of natural <br>
            resources (e.g. firewood, non-timber forest products, water, ...) is limited.

        <p id="midTitle" >Corrent issues with protected areas.</p>
        <p>
                Losely linked with poor management are threats from widespread and either poorly <br>
                managed or illegal human activites occuring within protected areas in many parts <br>
                of the world. These include logging, poaching of protected animals, mining, and <br>
                encroachment by human settlements and agriculture. Human activities outside of <br>
                protected areas are also often a threat â€“ such as those leading to pollution, <br>
                climate change, and the introduction of invasive species.
